# Database Documentation with dbdocs

Documenting a database schema is essential for maintaining and scaling databases, especially as they grow more complex over time. `dbdocs` offers a powerful and automated way to create and maintain database documentation, making it easier to track changes, maintain accuracy, and ensure that developers, analysts, and other stakeholders have up-to-date documentation at all times.

## Why Use dbdocs?

As databases evolve, manually updating documentation can become a significant challenge. Without automated tools, database documentation can quickly become outdated or incomplete, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and misunderstandings within teams. Automated documentation with `dbdocs` addresses these issues by streamlining the process, keeping records accurate, and helping ensure consistency between the actual database schema and its documentation.

## What dbdocs Solves

- **Automated Documentation**: `dbdocs` automates the process of generating documentation from your live database schema, saving time and reducing human error.
- **Scalability**: Handles large databases and complex schemas with ease, ensuring documentation remains organized even as databases grow.
- **Real-time Updates**: Documentation can be regenerated whenever there are schema updates, so teams are always working with the latest information.
- **Customizable Notes**: Allows for additional annotations and comments to clarify schema fields and relationships.

## Key Features of dbdocs

- **DBML Syntax Support**: Uses `DBML` (Database Markup Language), a human-readable format for describing database structures.
- **CLI Tool**: The `dbdocs` CLI makes it easy to interact with databases and generate documentation quickly.
- **Collaborative Sharing**: Documentation can be shared with team members directly or hosted on `dbdocs.io` for easy access.
- **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Supports integration with CI/CD pipelines, so documentation is kept up-to-date with every database change.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Basic knowledge of databases and SQL**.
- **A database schema to document** (we’ll use a PostgreSQL example in this guide).
- **DBML CLI and dbdocs installed**.

### Step 1: Install DBML CLI and dbdocs

The `dbdocs` CLI is available as an NPM package. Install it globally using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g dbdocs
```
### Step 2: Export Your Database Schema to DBML

With the `DBML CLI` installed, you can convert your PostgreSQL schema into the DBML format. This command generates a `.dbml` file that represents your database structure:

```bash
$ dbdocs db2dbml postgres <connection-string> -o database.dbml
```

```
✔ Connecting to database <db-name>... done
✔ Generating DBML... done.
✔ Wrote to database.dbml
```
This command will export your database schema and save it into a file called database.dbml

## Step 3: Edit and Add Notes to the DBML File (Optional)

1. **Open the DBML File**:
   Locate the `database.dbml` file generated in the previous step and open it in a text editor of your choice.

2. **Add Descriptions and Annotations**:
   - Add descriptions to tables and fields to clarify their purpose and usage.
   - Annotations can be used to explain relationships, constraints, or any additional information that could be useful for others viewing the documentation.
   - Descriptive notes make the documentation easier to understand and help others quickly grasp the structure and logic of your database.

   ### Example
   In `database.dbml`, you can add descriptions like this:

   ```dbml
   Table users {
     id int [primary key, note: "Unique identifier for each user"]
     name varchar [note: "Name of the user"]
     email varchar [unique, note: "User email address, must be unique"]
   }

## Step 4: Generate and Publish Documentation with dbdocs

### 1. Log in to dbdocs

To begin, log into your dbdocs account using the following command:

```bash
dbdocs login
```
### 2. Publish the DBML File

Next, publish the DBML file to dbdocs.io by running the
command:

```bash
dbdocs build database.dbml
```
This command uploads the DBML file to dbdocs.io, creating shareable, visually appealing documentation for your database schema.

# Challenges of Manual Database Documentation

Maintaining and updating database documentation manually can be a daunting and error-prone task. In large, rapidly changing database environments, it becomes increasingly difficult to ensure that the documentation stays accurate and up-to-date. Some of the challenges of manual database documentation include:

- **Outdated Documentation**: As databases grow and evolve, it becomes time-consuming to keep track of schema changes. Without an automated process, documentation can quickly become outdated, leading to discrepancies between the actual database structure and what is documented.
  
- **Inconsistencies**: Manual updates are prone to errors, and without strict guidelines, multiple versions of documentation may emerge, resulting in inconsistencies that make it difficult to trust the data.

- **Increased Time and Effort**: Continuously updating and verifying documentation as the database schema changes requires a significant amount of time and effort, which could otherwise be used for other tasks.

## The Solution: Automating Documentation with dbdocs

Automating your database documentation with dbdocs solves these challenges by:

- **Ensuring Accuracy**: With dbdocs, your database schema is automatically exported into a structured, readable format, reducing the chances of errors or outdated information.
  
- **Staying Up-to-Date**: dbdocs continuously updates documentation in line with any changes to the schema, ensuring that your documentation always reflects the latest version of the database.
  
- **Time-Saving**: Automation speeds up the process of generating, updating, and maintaining documentation, saving valuable time and effort for your team.

## Conclusion

By automating database documentation with dbdocs, you can ensure that your documentation is always current, accurate, and accessible. As your database grows and changes, dbdocs will keep the documentation up-to-date with minimal effort, reducing errors and improving communication across teams. This approach enhances productivity and eliminates the complexity of manual documentation, allowing you to maintain high-quality database documentation effortlessly.
